## 💡 How recoilly Works

recoilly controls recoil by gently moving your mouse in the opposite direction when you shoot. This counters the automatic “kick” your weapon makes, helping you stay on target.

It uses an overlay that runs quietly on your desktop. This overlay shows important information without blocking your view.

The app works with games running in full screen or windowed mode. All processing happens on your computer, so you do not need an internet connection.

---

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

recoilly runs entirely on your own PC. It does not collect or send any personal data. No internet connection is required after downloading.

The app only reads keyboard and mouse input to control recoil. It does not access your files or network activities.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, here are some common fixes:

- **App won’t open:** Check your antivirus or firewall settings. Allow recoilly to run.
- **Recoil not controlled in game:** Make sure the game is running and selected inside recoilly.
- **Overlay not showing:** Try running recoilly as administrator.
- **Performance lag:** Close other programs running in the background.

If problems continue, review the support information on the releases page or contact the developer.
